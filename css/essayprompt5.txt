As I walk out of the hospital room, I hear the nurse struggle to keep him down. I hear his shaky hands push the infusion pump away from his bed, hear his slurred attempts to convince the nurse that he’s okay, that the doctors don’t know what they’re doing, that they need to let him go. I hear him scream my name. But I don’t look back; I learned the first few times that it only makes it harder to compose myself, harder to walk back to my car and make the drive home. My dad’s illnesses are genetic; I fear every day that I may wake up in a hospital without any recollection of the past few days or weeks, or that I may lose my job and myself to fatigue and complacency. Every day I pay homage to this fear by proving it wrong, by showing success through hours of hard-work, through hours of studying and pushing my academic boundaries. After his first schizophrenic episode in 2010, I pushed myself to achieve straight A’s for the first time in my life, and have continued to do so in every class since, to prove to myself that I am not a carbon-copy of my father, that I have the ambition and drive to overcome the genetic limits that have plagued my fears all my life. After his reckless disregard for health put him in the hospital, I, despite not even knowing how to float, joined the swim team to choose for myself that I would never experience the same. Following a mental breakdown during one of his manic episodes in which he recounted his life regrets, I taught myself computer programming to prove that I had the capacity to choose where I end up in life. I have chosen to strain my academic limitations by choosing my school’s hardest classes and by enrolling in sophomore level college courses at my local university solely because I refuse to be the product of a genetic raw deal, and I work every day to break the mould that tries to shape me.
